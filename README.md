# Snake Game

A classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food, while avoiding obstacles and its own body.

## Description

This is a web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a modern take on the classic Snake Game. In this version of the game, the player controls a snake that moves around the game board to eat food and grow in length, while avoiding obstacles such as walls and the snake's own body. The game gets progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer, and the player must be strategic to avoid collisions and score as many points as possible.
